When I joined Liefery the IT team was remote-friendly. What do I mean here by "remote-friendly"? People were allowed to work remotely one day of the week. Some of my colleagues were working from home more often (2-3 days in some weeks) and it was not uncommon that somebody travels for 2 weeks and works remotely during that time.

At the same time, remote work was perceived as a "special mode". All our meetings were happening in the office, so quite often people would say "Ali is not in the office today and I'd like to hear her input, so let's postpone the meeting to tomorrow". This may work in a smaller team, but as the team starts to grow it becomes impossible to schedule a meeting when everyone is in the office.

Another thing that bothered me was that people were disappearing in a communication black hole when working remotely. We were using the remote time as the time where you can focus completely on the task in front of you by cutting off all communication channels. But this doesn't work like this. First of all, the task in front of you may not be the current priority. The chances are that your current priority may be talking with your colleague, because this conversation will "unblock" them. If you cut off all communication channels you put more strain on your colleagues physically present in the office, because they will have to take the pressure of you.

If your reason for working remotely is that you can't focus in the office then your office setup is wrong and your communication patterns in the team are broken. Escaping into remote work is not going to solve your problems if your communication patterns are broken.

Having worked at a remote-only company before, I knew how effective remote work could be. I decided to use this experience to improve how remote work looks like at Liefery.

I started by gathering my thoughts and writing them down. This resulted in a blog post on my personal blog - "Make your meetings more async". I encourage you to read it, but the key points are:

1. Create a live editable agenda
2. Invite many people, but make the participation optional
3. Find time that works for most people, but don't strive to find a time that works for everybody. It's really hard when the team is bigger.
4. Record the meeting
5. Start the meeting on time.
6. Follow the order in the agenda.
7. At the end of the meeting create action items.

I brought up this subject during one of our weekly retrospectives. We discussed it in the team and decided to include these points in our team handbook - Don't panic. We also added some points aiming to improve the communication in general:

If you have a question and you are 95% sure that person A can answer it, don't reach out to this person directly. Instead formulate your question on Slack, in the shared channel and mention person A. It is possible that some other people will be able to answer the question as well. It is also likely that some other people will be interested in knowing the answer for the question.

If you have a question that should not be posted in a shared channel, please consider sending a Slack direct message first, instead of going to the desk of your coworker and asking. This allows them to respond at the time convenient to them, without interrupting their flow. When deciding whether to send a Slack message or ask directly, take into account how urgent your question is.

If you want to propose changes in the existing company processes or general code techniques, open a pull request that documents the changed situation Other team members can then leave comments at the time convenient to them. If there is a general agreement, the PR can be merged. If not, it is time for a meeting. Do not default to scheduling a meeting, start with an asynchronous discussion in a PR first.

If you go back and forth with somebody in a chat conversation or during the code review, talk with them offline (when both of you are in the office) or start a video call (when one of you is not in the office). Rule of thumb: if you have gone back and forth 3 times, it's time for synchronous communication.

When working remotely make it clear to your co-workers that you're starting your work day - for example say "Hi" on Slack. It's fine to turn off notifications for some time to focus on a task, but be sure to check them a few times during the day. Let other team members know that you are available for help by posting it explicitly on Slack from time to time.

Of course, just documenting the principles won't change the behaviour of the team. Every change is a process and this process requires time and reminders. But at least we had a shared understanding how we want to work and a goal to strive to. The communication patterns in the team started to change slowly and we also changed our office space to a bigger one, which reduced the distractions. We were still fighting with people "disappearing" when working remotely, but the situation was improving.

My new personal goal was to include remote people in our meetings. When I was calling for the meeting I started to prepare a video call 10 minutes before. My laptop was the host of the meeting and we were putting a microphone in the middle of the table in the meeting room. At that time we were using Youtube Live Streaming, because it allows people to join the call as participants or viewers and automatically records a video. It was an improvement over completely offline meetings, but it had a couple of drawbacks:
1. it required manual setup (about 5 minutes)
2. it required the person calling the meeting to always remember to do the setup
3. the audio quality was bad for remote people. They could barely hear what's happening in the meeting room.
4. there was no way for remote people to signal that they want to say something

The remote people were now included in the meeting, but they were second-class citizens.

We continued like that for a while until I decided to bring up the topic during our weekly retrospective again. I expressed my wish to improve the remote communication further. As an action item from that meeting I volontueered to prepare a presentation. I called this presentation "Remote-first vision", because I was thinking about it as something we could do, but I expected some push back in the team, so I didn't want to start the discussion immediately, but rather present the whole idea.

So how do I define remote-first? Remote-first means that remote work is our default approach. We are a team of people that all work from different locations.​ Sometimes people come to the office to hang out with each other, but our processes don’t depend on it​.

During my professional work I noticed that the communication in fully colocated teams works well and that the communication in fully remote teams also works well. What doesn't work are the solutions in the middle - like our remote-friendly approach. In this model remote people are being left out. By switching to remote-first we make everybody a first-class team member.

The most important change that I proposed was "Every meeting is a remote meeting":
1. Every meeting is a recorded video call​
2. Everybody participates individually from their own laptop​
3. Do not use computer speakers, they cause an echo.​
4. Do not use your computer microphone, it accentuates background noise. ​
5. In video calls everyone should own a camera and a headset, even when they are in the same room. This helps seeing and hearing the person that is talking. It also allows people to easily talk and mute themselves.​
6. You wouldn't share an office seat together, so don't share your virtual seat at the table.​
7. Everybody should take care of their setup and internet connection so it allows video calls.​

I wrote it down based on my experience at GitLab and GitLab Handbook.
